[Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/) Guided Project: Answering Business Questions using SQL

## About
This is my Jupyter Notebook for the [Guided Project: Answering Business Questions using SQL](https://www.dataquest.io/m/191/guided-project%3A-answering-business-questions-using-sql) from the [SQL Intermediate: Table Relations and Joins course](https://www.dataquest.io/course/sql-joins-relations) from [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/). Using `Python` and `SQL`, I answer the following business questions about a fictional music company called Chinook:

1) Given a list of prospective records and their respective genres, which three records should we purchase based on previous sales?
2) Which employees have the best sales, and are there any qualities that distinguish them from the rest?
3) Which countries have the best sales, and where can we grow?

This project is about 63% complete. The remaining steps include analyzing albums versus individual tracks and perfecting visualizations.

I started this project prior to beginning my MS in Business Analytics. It will be interesting to compare this novice attempt to my future projects/repositories.
